# IT-Risk-Assessment---ACME-Online-Store-E-Commerce-

## Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a information security and privacy risk assessment for a e-commerce organization (ACME Online Store). The assessment aims to identify critical information assets, evaluate associated threats and vulnerabilities, assess risk levels, and recommend security controls aligned with PIPEDA and PCI DSS requirements.
This project demonstrates practical application of GRC principles, qualitative risk analysis, and executive-level risk reporting.

## Step-by-Step Methodology
**Asset Identification**
   - Identified critical information assets supporting e-commerce operations, including customer databases, payment systems, employee email, cloud infrastructure, and endpoints.

**Threat & Vulnerability Analysis**
- Analyzed potential threats (e.g., unauthorized access, phishing, data breaches) and vulnerabilities affecting each asset.

**Risk Evaluation**
- Assessed risks using a qualitative approach, evaluating:
- Impact (Low / Medium / High)
- Likelihood (Low / Medium / High)
- Determined inherent risk levels before controls.

**Control Mapping**
- Mapped recommended administrative and technical controls to PIPEDA Safeguards Principle and PCI DSS requirements.

**Residual Risk Assessment**
- Estimated residual risk after proposed control implementation.

**Risk Documentation**
- Documented findings in a structured risk register for traceability and compliance readiness.

**Visualization & Reporting**
- Built an executive-level Power BI dashboard and produced a formal risk assessment report.
